##Simulating Coin Flips

Grab the starter file [coin flip.py](coin flip.py) and copy it into a new Python window.

The goal of the program is to simulate flipping a coin 1000 times. It uses a function flip_coin() that is incomplete. It's your job to finish it.

Here is one approach to building your function:
* Pick a random number between 1 and 2 (where have you done this before?)
* If the random number is 1 return heads. Else return tails. (where have you done an if/else?)

This line of code is how you can return heads:

```python
return "heads"
```

That's it! Test it out and see how many times can your program flip a coin a second.

Extra:  See if you can count how many coin flips it takes before you get 10 heads in a row.


##Simulating Dice Rolls

Grab the starter file [dice rolls.py](dice rolls.py) and copy it into a new Python window.

This program uses an array named totals. An array is a variable that remembers a list of info in specific slots (the slots start counting at 0). 

This is how you can set a specific slot in the array. In this example we are setting spot 5 (remember it counts starting at zero) to be 99.

```python
totals[5] = 99
```

This is how we can look up what the number is in a spot and print it out. This would print 99

```python
print totals[5]
```

Your job is to complete the dice_roll() function. It should roll two 6-sided dice and add the rolls together. It should return their total.

That's it! Test it and see if it is faster or slower than the coin flip program. 

Take home challenge: can you change the program to roll 3 dice? How many slots would you have to add to the array? How about 5 dice?
