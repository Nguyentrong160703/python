##PyGame Animation

Grab the starter file [animation.py](animation.py) and copy it into a new Python window.

Download the image [beach_ball.png](beach_ball.png) and save it in the same location as your Python file (you can right click the image and select "save image as").

Try running it!

If you receive the error: 

```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:/Python25/pygame tester.py", line 16, in <module>
    my_ball = pygame.image.load('beach_ball.png')
error: Couldn't open beach_ball.png
```
    
Then your image file was not saved in the correct location!

Read through the file to see what it is doing.

####Challenge #1
Can you make the beach ball appear lower on the screen?

####Challenge #2
Can you make the beach ball go twice as fast?

####Challenge #3
Can you switch the beach ball's direction?

####Challenge #4
Can you add a second image to the animation? Download a small image from the internet ([look, here is one](minecraft.gif) or do a Google image search) and save it in the same location as your Python file. What new variables do you need to create?

####Challenge #5
Can you make one of the images travel in both the x and y direction and bounce off all four walls?

####Challenge #6
Can you make the other image travel left and right, bouncing off the walls and doubling in speed each bounce? Increasing the speed by 10% might work better. You also might need to give it a max speed!
